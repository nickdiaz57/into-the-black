# into-the-black

Into the Black is an interactive text-based adventure game in which a player controls a spaceship making its way through an unforgiving galaxy.

Players enter their name to create a profile, which will keep a record of their previous wins and losses.  Players move their controlled character along a randomized grid of ASCII characters, encountering scripted events along the way.  Players will need to maintain their fuel and health levels over the course of the journey; running out of either resource will cause the game to end in a loss.  A player's goal is to reach the beacon, marked with the character "G", at the far end of the map.  Successfully reaching the beacon will end the game in a victory and automatically submit a record of the game to the database, which will attribute the player's victory to their profile.
